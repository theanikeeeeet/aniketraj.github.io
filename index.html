    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a 2nd-year B.Tech student in Computer Science and Design at Atria Institute of Technology, affiliated with VTU. My engineering journey began in 2023, and I aim to graduate in 2027. I completed my 10th and 12th from my hometown Darbhanga under the CBSE board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since moving to Bengaluru, I've been exploring new places and delving into event management. I've attended numerous events, met amazing people, and built valuable connections that have helped me grow in the field. I've taken on managing tasks and learned along the way, making it a rewarding journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I have been editing videos and photos for the past two years, working with transitions, After Effects, and other techniques to improve and create better content.

    <h2>Notable Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Hypermetropia and Its Correction</h3>
      <p>Based on a CGV project, we chose hypermetropia (farsightedness) and its correction using convex lenses. By simulating this with Python, we discussed how convex lenses adjust the focal point onto the retina, enabling clear vision of nearby objects. We used an online compiler through the terminal in Python, executing it in different functions or codes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Task Management Website</h3>
      <p>Developed a task manager using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to keep track of tasks. Users can add new tasks, mark them as done, and delete them when finished. It's a to-do list that can be used on a computer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Synced Lyrics Displayer</h3>
      <p>Created a music player using jQuery that displays the lyrics of a song in sync with the music. As the song plays, the lyrics appear on the screen at the right time, similar to karaoke. This project helped us learn how to sync lyrics with music and was a fun and educational experience.</p>
